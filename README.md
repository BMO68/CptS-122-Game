DRAG RACERS: racing with only one rule: winning.
Just kidding, you win by crossing the finish line at the far
end of the screen. Two players, blue car and red car. 
To accelerate, each player must race to
press their forward key faster than the other. Player 1 controls the W key,
and player 2 controls the Up key.

Notes: made primarily with C++ (no clue why GitHub says it was made with mostly C)
and a downloaded SFML library
